  <h3>Dylan Thomas, 1914 - 1953</h3>

    <div>
      <p id='p1' class='line'>Do not go gentle into that good night,</p>
      <p id='p2' class='line'>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;</p>
      <p id='p3' class='line'>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p id='p4' class='line'>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,</p>
      <p id='p5' class='line'>Because their words had forked no lightning they</p>
      <p id='p6' class='line'>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p id='p7' class='line'>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright</p>
      <p id='p8' class='line'>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,</p>
      <p id='p9' class='line'>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p id='p10' class='line'>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,</p>
      <p id='p11' class='line'>And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,</p>
      <p id='p12' class='line'>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p id='p13' class='line'>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight</p>
      <p id='p14' class='line'>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,</p>
      <p id='p15' class='line'>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p id='p16' class='line'>And you, my father, there on the sad height,</p>
      <p id='p17' class='line'>Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.</p>
      <p id='p18' class='line'>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
      <p id='p19' class='line'>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
